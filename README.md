# Astro-Siege
In this game, you take command of a starship to defend against waves of alien invaders.
 I built this from scratch using Java, with a focus on game development fundamentals like:

ðŸ”¹ Game loop for smooth animation and gameplay.

ðŸ”¹ JFrame and JPanel to create the interface.

ðŸ”¹ Key handlers for controlling the ship and firing bullets.

ðŸ”¹ Random alien generation with unique colours and patterns after each level.

ðŸ”¹ Collision detection between bullets and aliens.

ðŸ”¹ A scoring system to track progress and an option to reset the game.

This project helped refine my Java programming skills, object-oriented design, and game mechanics. The journey was challenging but rewarding!
